Hitting level 60, 70, and 80 will grant all your characters on that account 10% extra experience
	gains until they hit that same level.
		Dev note: Let me give an example of how this works. Say you just hit level 70 on your
			main character. You previously had the 10% extra on all your alts up till 60 but
			now they will have 20% until 60 and from 60-70 they will have 10%. And if you hit
			level 80 the same thing will happen again. 30% -> 20% -> 10% going to 60, 70, and 80
			respectively.

Renamed the old Hardcore to Hardmode. Nothing else changed besides the name.

Added a Hardcore mode. Similar to the new Classic WoW version except if you die your character 
	isn't gone. It just lost its Hardcore status and is ineligble for future rewards.

If you get to certain thresholds (Levels 20, 40, and 60) then you will gain an exp buff.
	Dev note: These each give 10% extra experience to all of your characters. They do not stop
		working at a given level unlike the generic level 60, 70, and 80 ones do.

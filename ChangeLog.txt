Successfully added a rested area at Malaka'jin!
	Developer Note:
		This took me quite a long time to figure out. Turns out AreaTable.dbc is stupid and needs to be
			ordered by MapID. Meaning you cannot place a new entry at the bottom. This makes it incredibly
			annoying to modify.

Modified stats on the ZG Paladin set.

Changed the Paladin ZG neck effect to lower the cooldown of holy shock by 0.5 seconds

Added a vendor Jin'dosh the Broker (190128) that sells ZG set items. Removed quests that used to do this.
	Only Paladin sets for now.

Added reputation and level requirements to Paladin ZG items.
	Other classes to come later.

The Punctured Voodoo Dolls that create the trinkets for classes now create a token used
	to buy the neck from the vendor instead.

Placement of some creatures done manually.

Fixed various DB Error log issues

Added additional text to the quest Lost Feather (30045) to help lead the player to the item

Readded creature equipment to one NPC. More to come later.

Blocked off Heroic: Deadmines.
